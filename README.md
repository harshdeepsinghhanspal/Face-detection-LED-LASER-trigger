# Face-detection-LED-LASER-trigger

Steps to run the programs-

[+] First upload the Arduino IDE code to Arduino Board.
[+] In case of error in uploading, rerun the codecheck, disconnect Arduino and then upload. Then connect Arduino and upload again.
[+] Above step should work and after successful uploading, run the Python code.
[+] Usually keeping serial object (SerialObject()) will make it automatically detect com port, if not then mention as I've done (SerialObject('com3')).
[+] Now run the Python code and enjoy ðŸ˜‰ðŸ¤™
